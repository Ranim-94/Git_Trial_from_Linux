SSH =  secure shell

Used for:
	- authentication
	- we don't need to use user name
	or password again when we work with GitLab

To set up SSH run the command:
	- ssh-keygen


Step 2: login to the Gitlab account

	-and then go to settings -> SSH keys
	- Copy the content of the .pub file 
	(created wen running ssh-keygen) and past it
	in the key space
